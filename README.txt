RPAN Media Player v1.5
By Leslie E. Krause

RPAN Media Player makes it possible to watch RPAN videos alongside a synchronized chat 
replay within a web browser. Both Firefox and Chrome are currently supported.

The required .json chat archives can be generated by the RPAN Chat Archive Wizard:

  https://www.globalstationtuner.org/rpan/chat_archive_wizard.html

Be sure that each '.json' file corresponds with an '.mp4' file, and that all files are
copied into the project folder. For example:

  /rpan_webplayer
  |- 31-Oct-2022_Halloween_Party.mp4
  |- 31-Oct-2022_Halloween_Party.json
  |- 24-Oct-2022_Playing_New_Games.mp4
  |- 24-Oct-2022_Playing_New_Games.json
  |- player.html
  |- README.txt
  |- LICENSE.txt

To run the RPAN Media Player, simply double-click on the 'player.html' document. Then
select (or drag-and-drop) the .json file associated with the video you want to watch.

Click '>' to pause or resume playback. The comments will appear in sync with the video. 
You can scan backward or forward through the video by clicking '<<' or '>>'. And you can
jump to a specific time using the progress bar at the bottom.
